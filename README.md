# PREDICTING THE FUTURE PRICE OF FOREX MARKET WITH MACHINE LEARNING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM CALLED LSTM NEURAL NETWORK

Achieving this will take the process below:

Collect historical data: The first step is to collect historical forex data for the currency pair you want to predict. This data can be obtained from a variety of sources, including online databases and financial institutions.

Preprocess the data: The next step is to preprocess the data, which may involve removing outliers, normalizing the data, and transforming it into a suitable format for training an LSTM model.

Split the data into training and validation sets: The historical data is then split into two sets: a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to train the LSTM model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Train the LSTM model: The LSTM model is trained on the training set using a backpropagation algorithm, which adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values.

Evaluate the model: The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using the validation set. This involves comparing the predicted values with the actual values and calculating metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Make predictions: Once the LSTM model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new data. This involves feeding the model with the most recent historical data and using it to predict the future exchange rate values.

Monitor the model performance: It's important to monitor the performance of the LSTM model over time and make adjustments as necessary. This may involve retraining the model on new data or changing the model parameters to improve its performance.

Overall, achieving forex market prediction using LSTM requires a combination of data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and monitoring. With careful attention to these steps, it's possible to build an effective and accurate LSTM model for forex market prediction.
